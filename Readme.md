# VSCode extensions for Dr.QP

A collection of VSCode extensions for Dr.QP to be used as workspace extensions in `.vscode/extensions` folder.

They exist in the separate repo to avoid bloating the main Dr.QP repo and slowing down CI.

These extensions contain fixes that have been contributed mainstream VSCode extensions, but not yet released.
